	After a short time working with devkit, I have some opinions about this engine. 
	Fast compiling is the only thing make me like devkit.  May be I am a C++ developer,
	so that I confront some problems when working with Javascript, especially devkit. 
	I mean how it compile and run a project. Beside, Debugger is the biggest problem 
	for me, it is incommodious.
	If I have to work with devkit, I think I will try to learn to debug Javascript in
	another smarter way. I mean I will write a framework which helps developers debug 
	easier and faster. 
	As I said, I work mainly with C++, specific in developing game with cocos2d-x. 
	With Javascipt, I am a newbie. When I start working with Javascript, I feel like 
	I am the most stupid deveploper all over the world. Beside, I installed devkit in
	my PC (run Windows 8 OS), but when I opened my project in Chrome, I saw nothing.
	I tried to resolve this big problem, but nothing happened. Although I tried in many
	ways, installed in many other PCs, its still not work. After that, I installed Ubuntu
	on my PC, and its fine now. I can develop game with devkit on my Ubuntu PC.
	Because I didnâ€™t know how to debug my game, I wrote my logic code in C++ to make sure
	that my code runs fine. Then, I ported to Javascript.  I know this is not a good way, 
	but being a newbie, all I need is running my project successfully. I've read documents, 
	tutorials about devkit, Javascript after my bussiness work. I also tried hard to make 
	a basic game. Despite many problems, many troubles when starting developing with devkit,
	 truthfully, I can tell that working with something new is really excited. 
	I still love C++, but I am willing to study and work more with Javascript/devkit after
	this first basic game. This short time working with devkit is an interesting experience for me.
